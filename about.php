              <p class="left-font"> At the end of a meal, how many times have you felt unhappy with the food?</p>
                <p class="left-font">It didn’t taste good, may be the dish needed more salt or it was too spicy for you.</p>

  <p class="left-font">You might have chosen a dish or restaurant based upon good reviews online but still you didn’t enjoy your meal. It happens all the time.</p>

  <p class="left-font">That’s because the food we each love depends upon our individual tastes, so picking a restaurant based upon someone else’s opinion doesn’t make sense.</p>

  <p class="left-font">Also, most menus have too many dishes to choose from and very little info to help you make a good choice. That leaves you taking a gamble.</p>

  <p class="left-font">That’s why you eat at the same restaurants and order the same dishes each time. You don’t want to risk having a bad meal.</p>

  <p class="left-font">dishq solves this problem by helping you discover great food based upon a combination of your personal tastes, mood, and situation. We focus on the food, not the restaurant.</p>
